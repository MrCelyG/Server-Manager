# False Positive Warning

## Antivirus Warning
Some antivirus programs. Or all, I don't know. Will belive that my program is a trojan that will delete all of your data and ask for bitcoin. Don't worry. It's not. Don't belive me? Just check the source code! It's. Literally. Right. Here.

### Why is this happening
Because part of the program's functionality is that it creates and alters files. I don't change any files that I did not **Explicitly create**.

I can guarantee that if you downloaded this from the **OFFICIAL** github, It is safe. Im not so sure about modified versions.

### What to do
If you really want to use this program then you should try to exclude it from your antivirus program.


#### Information for Nerds
If you can check the CreateServer file. And all other files. And you will see that I am using the Json module for the configuration file I made. BUT, I also use the os module to create directories and the open function to create files. I don't know how to make this fancier. Also this thing is still Actively in development. Not even advanced enough to make a **Beta** Version.
